## More Things
More Things is a small, Vanilla-style mod designed to add more functionality to the game without feeling out of place with Vanilla mechanics. It adds several new Blocks and Items to the game, most are intended as upgrades for existing contents of the game.

### Download
More Things is available on CurseForge, either direct on the [CurseForge Website](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/more-things-vanilla) or via the CurseForge Launcher.

### Issues
More Things is currently in alpha, meaning there are likely to be numerous bugs within the codebase. If you encounter a bug, please log an [Issue](https://github.com/OfficialTomPG/More-Things/issues). Where an updated version is released, we will endeavour not to introduce game-breaking changes but this has a possibility of occurring throughout the alpha life-cycle.

### Features
More Things is intended as a Vanilla-plus style mod. Content is carefully considered before being added and retains a Vanilla-style feel, with the intention of never feeling overly modded but rather that some Quality of Life additions have been added. If you have a feature that you want adding, please submit a [Feature Request](https://github.com/OfficialTomPG/More-Things/issues) but, as noted, content is carefully considered and your feature may be rejected from the mod.
